The event manager can use an event management system to ensure smooth operations. Our Event Management Database is designed to improve efficiency. Administrative tasks such as ticket sales, bookings, booking location, etc., are automated, making event planning more streamlined. Our database will also aid in Better decision making, allowing managers to obtain insight regarding vendor availability, attendee demographics, etc., which can help managers adjust marketing when needed. Additionally, managers can easily track revenue coming in from attendees, generate reports for top-spending attendees, etc. Lastly, multi-user access can allow multiple vendors, organizers, ticketing partners, etc., to access the database while maintaining data integrity.

##  Database
The event management database model depicted in the image is designed to efficiently track and manage various aspects of event planning. The Clients table stores client details, linking them to the Events table, which contains event-specific information such as event names and dates. Events are associated with Bookings, which connect clients to Venues, storing details like venue capacity and location. The Attendees table records participant details, including demographics and referral sources, and links them to their respective events. Financial transactions are managed through Client_Payments, which track payments made by clients for bookings, and Attendee_Payments, which record attendee payment details for event participation. The database's structured relationships ensure seamless coordination between clients, events, venues, and financial transactions, enhancing operational efficiency and data accuracy for event managers.

## Queries 
1. Query 1 provides key insights into client booking behavior and total payments, helping businesses identify their most valuable and engaged customers. By retrieving a list of clients who have made multiple bookings, it highlights repeat customers who are driving sustained revenue. The query counts the total number of bookings per client and sums up their total payments, offering a clear picture of customer spending patterns.

Filtering out clients with only one booking ensures that the analysis focuses on high-value customers, which is useful for customer retention strategies. Ordering the results by total bookings and then by total payments allows businesses to prioritize their top clients for loyalty programs, exclusive discounts, or premium services. This insight can be leveraged for targeted marketing efforts, optimizing customer relationship management, and improving service offerings to encourage continued engagement.

   Counting the total number of bookings per client (COUNT(Bookings.booking_id)).
   Sums up the total payment made by each client (SUM(Client_Payments.client_payment_amount)).
 Uses HAVING COUNT(Bookings.booking_id) > 1 to filter only those who booked more than once.
 Orders the results first by total bookings (descending) and then by total payments (descending)

This query helps to provide insights like determining which types of events perform best, enabling targeted marketing strategies to maximize attendance. Additionally, it can guide decisions on venue selection, staffing, and resource allocation based on historical attendance data. Moreover, managers will be provided with data on which events attract the most people, allowing them to analyze trends and replicate successful strategies. Finally, this query ensures that event spaces are adequately sized and staffed to handle expected crowds, reducing overcrowding and improving the attendee experience. This query works by: Displaying the event ID, event name, and count of total attendees per event.
